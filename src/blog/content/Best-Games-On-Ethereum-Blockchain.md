CryptoKitties is one of the world’s first games to be built on blockchain technology—the same breakthrough that makes things like Bitcoin and Ethereum possible. Bitcoin and ether are cryptocurrencies but CryptoKitties are cryptocollectibles. You can buy, sell, or trade your CryptoKitty like it was a traditional collectible, secure in the knowledge that blockchain will track ownership securely.

<h2>7. Crypto Celebrities</h2>

Crypto Celebrities is part game, part investing, and part charity. You can buy and sell celebrity smart contracts. There is only one smart contract per celebrity – once you own it, you’re the only one in the world who has it. Until someone else comes along and pays you up to double your purchase price to own that contract! Every time you buy a smart contract, it automatically doubles in value. If someone else wants to buy it, they have to pay you two times what you purchased the contract for, doubling your investment. When celebrities verify their smart contract, they can opt to have 3-percent of every transaction made on their smart contract sent directly to a charity of their choice.
