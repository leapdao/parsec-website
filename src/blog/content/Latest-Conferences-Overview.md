Hello, community!

Bunch of team members from our community has attended multi blockchain related conferences in the past month. Here is a couple of them:
- <a href="https://www.meetup.com/blockchainstartupslviv/events/253546111/">Introducing Blockchain 3.0</a> 
- <a href="https://dou.ua/calendar/22188/">Lviv blockchain meetup</a>
- <a href="https://dou.ua/calendar/21331/">Lviv .NET TechTalk: Blockchain Edition</a>

We do strongly believe that sharing knowledge about blockchain and it benefits is one of our main goals because blockchain technology has multiple benefits over the traditional approach in various areas.

PARSEC Labs is focused mainly on building PoS based Plasma chain but without finding a way to integrate our chain into some existing business models it can die as a product very soon. That is why we do believe that communication and finding new potential user/partners/developers for our community is the main goal for our Communication circle.

To attract more people to visit conferences we have put together main topics which were covered on a blockchain oriented conferences which we have attended in the past few weeks:

- A Beginner’s Guide to Smart Contracts - the best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driver’s license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.

- How to create smart contracts - this topic was covered on multiple meetups and as a summary, we can say that all contracts are written in a programming language called Solidity, a language similar to JavaScript. Before start developer must have Ganache installed, which will be the tool he/she will use to create a private blockchain that runs on our machine only. Also usually you need to download your own copy of MyEtherWallet to be able to execute smart contracts.

- What is a Crypto Token - tokens are a representation of a particular asset or utility, that usually resides on top of another blockchain. Tokens can represent basically any assets that are fungible and tradeable, from commodities to loyalty points to even other cryptocurrencies!

- What are the current limitations of blockchain platforms? - Some people in the blockchain industry have pointed out that blockchain has become overhyped, when, in reality, the technology has limitations and is inappropriate for many digital interactions. But through research and development, success and failure, and trial and error, we have learned the current issues and limitations of blockchains are Complexity, Network size, Transaction costs, Network speed, Human error, Unavoidable security flaw, Politics.

- .NET Blockchain platforms - stratis launched the much anticipated nStratis Development Framework (SDF) – enabling blockchain development in C# and .NET. SDF marks a major milestone accomplished by the Stratis development team that will allow support for the accelerated development of powerful, open source, cross-platform blockchain applications on Microsoft’s .net framework.

- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/">Azure BaaS</a> - a common blockchain pattern is IoT-enabled monitoring of an asset as it moves along a multi-party supply chain. A great example of this pattern is the refrigerated transportation of perishable goods like food or pharmaceuticals where certain compliance rules must be met throughout the duration of the transportation process. In this scenario, an initiating counterparty (such as a retailer) specifies contractual conditions, such as a required humidity and temperature range, that the custodians on the supply chain must adhere to. At any point, if the device takes a temperature or humidity measurement that is out of range, the smart contract state will be updated to indicate that it's out of compliance, recording a transaction on the blockchain and triggering remediating events downstream.

- Introducing Blockchain 3.0 - the first version of blockchain of bitcoin blockchain focuses on peer-to-peer money transfer. As blockchain technology evolved from this version 1.0, Ethereum has emerged as version 2.0 allowing decentralized apps to be built on top of it. Version 3.0 promises to be highly scalable with millions of transactions running on it with the aim of allowing real-world complex applications to run atop.

- Write your own blockchain with Tendermint - write a state-machine in any language (e.g. Golang, Python, etc), and plug it into Tendermint’s consensus engine. Tendermint is responsible for p2p networking, consensus, and transaction broadcasting. After nodes come to consensus on a block, they push it to the state-machine via a unix-socket protocol called <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/abci">ABCI</a> (formerly known as TMSP).

We hope that you will find these topics interesting for you and this will motivate you to join us in some upcoming events. If you are planning to visit some interesting conference - let us now at our socials, we might join you there.
